## The Bug

This detection logic relies on PowerShell records that include Get-NETTCPConnection substring.

here is an inconsistency in how User Principal Names (UPNs) are extracted for 'Add user' versus 'Delete user' operations, particularly for guest accounts, which can lead to a failure in joining the creation and deletion events. That failure can be abused by an attacker to bypass detection.

## Log Source Context

- **Logsource category:** `AuditLogs` in EntraID = OperationName `Add User` and `Delete User`
- **Logged fields:** `TargetUserPrincipalName`, `CreatedByUserPrincipalName`, etc.
- **Vulnerable field:** `TargetUserPrincipalName` post formatting prior to key use in inner join.

## Bypass

### Method Name Obfuscation via PowerShell String Concatenation

The detection logic uses different methods to extract the TargetUserPrincipalName for 'Add user' and 'Delete user' operations, leading to potential mismatches that prevent the inner join from correlating events. Specifically, for 'Add user', it uses trim(@'\"', tostring(TargetResource.userPrincipalName)), which retains the full UPN string. For 'Delete user', it uses extract(@'([a-f0-9]{32})?(.*)', 2, tostring(TargetResource.userPrincipalName)), which is designed to strip an optional GUID prefix (common in guest account UPNs) and capture the remainder. If a guest account is created with a UPN like GUID#EXT#user@domain.com, the 'Add user' extraction will yield the full string including the GUID, while the 'Delete user' extraction will yield only #EXT#user@domain.com. This inconsistency causes the TargetUserPrincipalName values to differ, breaking the inner join and allowing the activity to go undetected.

## Impact

False Negative: Account Created and Deleted in Short Timeframe suceeds without detection as inner join fails.
